# TODOs

## review lookup

* fix typing of lookup, which may also return undefined
* review if lookup should be moved to arraylist

## experiment with immutability, with type system + maybe proxy objects or something similar

## Compare unique with rmdups from haskell book p.86

## Review possibilities to implement typesafe variadic compose

* maybe see haskell book
